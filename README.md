# Discover Montréal
This is a a full-stack MERN app, with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality, allowing users to share, rate and comment on attractions in and around the city of Montréal.

Built as part of a team, this is my third project during the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly.

## The App: Discover Montréal
### Live version
*A live version of the app can be found here*

Discover Montréal is a MERN stack app designed for a community of users to share information on local attractions in and around Montreal. 
Visitors to the site can browse index and show pages that provide details of  the local attractions, including ratings and comments left by other users.
Users who are registered and logged in can post comments and ratings on locations.
Users can furthermore go through an extra sign-up step to register as Contributors. Contributors have a personal profile and can create new locations, which are then available for other users to view, comment on and rate.

### General planning and process

We used Figma to create a wireframe, outlining the look of the site,  as well as key components and the user’s journey.
This wireframe was revisited and updated at various points during the project.


The team also used Trello to organise daily tasks (agreed each day at a stand-up meeting), and record various other important aspects of the project as it progressed, such as  bugs and blockers, nice-to-have extra features etc.
